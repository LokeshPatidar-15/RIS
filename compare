 Fig. 3: BER vs Distance (L)

Observation            	1 RIS	2 RISs	           Difference
BER at short distance	  Low	Even lower	         Slight improvement
BER at long distance	  Rises significantly      Rises slowly	Much better stability
Curve shape	Increases   steeply	Smoother,flatter Improved coverage


 Fig. 4: BER vs SNR

Observation	              1 RIS	               2 RISs	           Difference
BER drop with SNR	        Gradual	              Faster drop	     More efficient
BER floor             	  ~10⁻³     	          ~10⁻⁴ or better  1 order of magnitude lower
SNR                       improvement	Moderate	~2–3 dB better	 Better performance at same SNR


 Fig. 5: Learning Curve (Loss vs Epochs)

Observation	       1 RIS	     2 RISs	      Difference
Initial loss	     Higher	     Lower	     Better initialization
Convergence speed	 Moderate	   Faster	     Learns quicker
Final loss	       Higher	     Lower	     More accurate model
